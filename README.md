# SFMLGUI
Try to create simple SFML GUI library

- Fixed bug in pressing the button causes an exit from program because the callback was not set
- Added ability to load GUI from file, see the file in repository to know how add widgets

- Want to create a GUI CREATOR for automatically creating GUI files

Don't know what to write and what to do next after GUI CREATOR, so I'll start creating game(another repository)
