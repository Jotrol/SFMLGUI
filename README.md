_I wanna know what it's like to be happy.\
I wanna know what it's like to wake up in \
the morning and feel like it's real when I'm laughin'.\
I wanna know what it's like to sit down with my friends\
and feel like they might understand me.\
I wanna know that the people around me care less about\
Grammys and more about family._\

ANOTHER DAY IN THE LIFE - ANOTHER UPDATE IN HUB

Toady I add a `Gui Creator`, where you can create a gui file.\
It's simple to chain with project, just `loadFromFile` and put in args name of file and `"frame"`.\
Added some new functions which make you more freedom for customizing your GUI\
  
Now you can change the color of text in button.\
Added new function to `Frame` for more stable callbacks. This function fix bug with a lot of presses.\
Now you can get font size from every widget.

_Enjoy and have a good time._
